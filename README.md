 ****Compress Files and Folder.****

This Python script allows users to compress a folder into compressed file types, including .zip, .tar, and .tgz. The compressed file is named based on the folder's name and the current date.


****Usage.****
Clone Repository: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to Directory: Using your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Run Script: Run the script by executing the following command:
python compress_file.py.

Enter Folder Path: Please enter the folder path you wish to compress when prompted.

Select Compression Type: Choose the desired compression type from the available options (zip, tar, tgz).

Compression Process: The script will compress the specified folder into the selected compression type. Upon completion, it will display a message indicating the success or failure of the compression process.


****Requirements.****
Python 3. x
os, tarfile, and zip file modules (usually included in Python standard library)
Naming Convention for .tgz Files
When the user selects .tgz as the compression type, the compressed file will be saved with the following naming convention: "name_of_the_folder_date_month_year.tgz". For example, if the folder is named "MyFolder" and the compression is done on February 27, 2023, the compressed file will be saved as "MyFolder_2023_02_27.tgz".
